"""The writing desk: a job of its own, separate from the hourly pipeline (owner, Oct 6 2026).

The pipeline (run.py, at :05 UTC) reads, analyses and prepares stories; this step (right after it, hourly.yml)
only writes. Publishing used to come last in a 20-50 minute run and was squeezed out (Oct 6: one run
spent 50 minutes reading and never asked the writer), and reading spent the Flash-Lite the writer
needed as its fallback.

Each run: the settled stories (editions.settled), most important first (priority.value), are
written one by one until this clock hour has `desk_per_hour` articles (owner: at least one an hour,
at most two), `desk_tries` stories were tried, or the time is up. The quality bar is unchanged:
no good essay, no article.

Seats (owner, Oct 9 2026): at most three an hour, two for any story and one (`desk_beat_seat`) only for
a Domains or Sport story (priority.is_beat). A beat story takes the beat seat first, so the two others
stay for the rest; with no beat story ready the beat seat stays EMPTY (never a third general article).
