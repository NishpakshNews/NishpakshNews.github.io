"""Editions: when an article is written, and when later reporting earns a follow-up (owner, Oct 5 2026).

Like a newspaper:
  * An article is written ONCE, when its coverage has settled: the publishing rule has been met and no
    new independent outlet has turned up for `settle_quiet_hours` (or `settle_max_hours` have passed
    since the rule was first met, so a story that keeps growing is still written the same day), OR the
    coverage is already broad: `settle_early_outlets` independent outlets are in (owner, Oct 11 2026: a
    story with that many outlets maps the news well, so it need not wait for a quiet spell or the cap).
    Measured on Oct 1-5 data: a 3-hour quiet wait sees 86% of the outlets a story ever gets, about
    4 hours after the rule is met.
  * A published article is closed. Its text, headline and statements never change; no model call is
    spent on it again; no new report joins it. Only its colours mature, by code (`mature`): the
    6-hour clock turns "developing" into "established" from the evidence it was written with.
  * Reports about a published event that arrive later gather in a fresh candidate story (grouping
    redirects them, stories.py). The candidate is read like any story, and is published as a
    follow-up only if, against its parent, it carries a lot of new information or a major
    development (`follow_up_ok`). The same bar holds on the parent's own date: there is no limit of
    one article per topic per day (owner, Oct 10 2026); the desk only writes a topic not yet covered
    today first (desk.ready).
  * A follow-up says what the parent already disputed or got wrong itself; the parent is never touched.
