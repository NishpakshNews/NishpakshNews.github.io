"""The readable story: one continuous news article written from the checked statements.

Division of labour:
  code   decides which statements exist, their verdicts, who makes each claim, and time order
  model  writes them as a news article: an opening that says who, where and what, then events in
         time order, then the investigation and each side's response; a disagreement sits with its subject
  code   validates every sentence and colours it by the weakest statement it cites

Attribution (decided with the reader in mind): outlet names never appear in the text; the colour
and the numbered source links already say who reported what. A claim is pinned on the person or
body that makes it ("his parents alleged", "police said"). Nothing carries "according to reports",
"reportedly" or "one report said" (owner, Oct 7 2026, option A): the article reads as written by one
author, and the colour, with its key under the headline, says how well each sentence is supported.
Only a dispute keeps whose each version is, and "allegedly" stays where the outlets use it.

A sentence is rejected (and replaced by plain wording) if it cites nothing valid, names an outlet,
contains a number not in the statements it cites, uses a loaded word any outlet used, states an
allegation without naming who makes it, or uses a false statement without saying it is false.
Statements no valid sentence covers are added in plain words, so nothing is silently dropped.

WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a senior news editor. Write the story below as ONE news article for ordinary
readers, the way a good newspaper reports it: clear, calm, flowing paragraphs. Not a list.

You may use ONLY the statements given. Each has an id and a status, may say who makes it ("said by"),
when it happened, which statements contradict it, and which statements are a party's response to it.
Statements marked CONTEXT are not the story's own event: background, a separate related event,
an explanation, a reaction, or what happens next.
A statement may carry a SHAPE: the form of sentence to write it in (who is named, with which verb, what
is added). Follow it; a statement with no SHAPE is stated plainly.
A statement may also carry a LINK: how its sentence connects to the statement before it in the same
paragraph (same speaker, an answer, a contrast, a later time, the same subject). Write the connection it
says; a statement with no LINK starts a new point and needs no connecting word. Never open a sentence with
"Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally" or "Notably": they carry no fact.

Structure: the article is written in SECTIONS, in this order, so that a reader who knows nothing about
the story first learns why it matters today, then how it came about, and then follows it as one
coherent story. The newsroom has already sorted the statements into sections AND into PARAGRAPHS, one
subject each, in the order they belong: write EXACTLY ONE paragraph for each PARAGRAPH below, in that
order, from ONLY its statements. Never move a statement to another paragraph, never join two
paragraphs, never split one. A PARAGRAPH says how it opens ("opens with ..."): begin it that way.
Within a paragraph write 2-4 sentences, the main point first, then what supports it. The sections:
  news        1-2 sentences, the thing that makes this a story today, with who, where and
              when, written from the statements in SECTION news (chosen for you): the first sentence
              tells the first of them (it must be cited in the lead); if there is a second, it is what
              happened today, told in the second sentence. Never the setting or background ("Donald Trump said 125 million people voted in
              India's election, mixing up India with Brazil", not "Brazil held an election on Sunday").
  background  how this came about: earlier events, each clearly with its own time
  explained   what a rule, term, post, finding or number means
  happened    what happened, in time order (the statements of the news are not repeated here)
  numbers     the figures: amounts, tolls, counts, percentages, each with what it measures
  say         what each person or body says: claims, allegations, positions, and the responses to them.
              Each PARAGRAPH is one speaker's argument (the main claim first, then its details); a
              response paragraph names who answers and what is answered. Name each speaker as given;
              never give one speaker's line to another
  related     other events the reports connect to this one, each with its own time and its own people;
              never blended into the story's event. Do not write "separately" or "in a separate case":
              the section's heading says it (unless a statement itself says so)
  next        what happens next: hearings, deadlines, required steps
Write only the sections that have statements (and "news"); skip the others.
A disagreement is written where its subject is, in the same paragraph as the rest of that subject, with
both versions and whose they are; never collected into a paragraph or section about differing accounts.
Never join two statements in one sentence unless they are about the same person, body, place or
thing. Say each fact ONCE: if two statements say the same thing, write it
once and cite both ids. Length: about {length} sentences, as the material allows; do not pad.

Write as ONE author telling the story to a reader, not as a summary of reports. The page colours every
sentence by how well it is supported, so the words never need to: NEVER write "according to reports",
"reportedly", "reports said", "one report said", "another report said", "it is reported".

Attribution, the way a good newspaper does it (important):
- NEVER name a newspaper, channel or website. Do not write "X reported", "according to X" for an outlet.
- ESTABLISHED and REPORTED (no "said by"): state plainly, with no attribution and no hedge.
- A statement with "said by" is what that person said; its text is the content. Write a speaker's
  statements together, one paragraph per subject, as the speaker's own argument: the main point first,
  then what supports it. Name the speaker ONCE with full name and role at first mention; after that the
  surname or the role ("Kabir", "the MLA"). One attribution may carry two points: "Kabir accused the
  police of interfering with voting in several booths and said 64 people had been detained in two
  months." NEVER "X stated ... X also stated ... X further stated ..." and never begin sentence after
  sentence with the speaker's name: move the attribution to the end ("..., Kabir said.") or let one
  "said" carry two points. No empty set-up sentences ("X set out their position."). Name the next
  speaker when the speaker changes. An accusation must always name who makes it.
- The verb: "said" unless the statement itself uses a stronger one ("accused", "denied", "threatened",
  "warned", "claimed"); then that one. Never a stronger verb than the statement uses.
- "he" / "she": ONLY for the people marked (he) or (she) in the list of people below, and only when
  nobody else could be meant. Everyone else: the surname or the role, never a pronoun.
- An accusation of a crime stays "allegedly" / "alleged" wherever the statement says so.
- RESPONSE: write the claim or finding and the party's response together, each pinned on its source:
  "A food analyst declared the sample unsafe; Nestle India said its product is safe." A response is
  not a contradiction: do not write "accounts differ" for it.
- DISPUTED (contradicted): write the disagreement itself, both versions, and whose they are where
  known: "The police put the toll at 40; the families say 50." NEVER write "other reports differ" or
  "accounts differ" without saying what the other account is. Only statements marked "contradicted
  by" disagree: two statements about different steps, dates, people or parts of the story do not.
- NAMES DIFFER: when a statement says the reports name different actors, name both ("Creative Bakers,
  named in some reports as Sugarr & Spice"), never pick one; say it ONCE, at the first mention.
- FALSE: say who claimed it and that the evidence shows it is false, citing the evidence given.
- ONE OUTLET ONLY: a single outlet reports it; include it, written plainly (pinned on its speaker if
  it has one). The page colours it purple; never add "one report said".

Never add any fact, name, number, place, cause, motive, adjective or opinion that is not in the
statements. Events may be told in order ("after", "later", "then"), but never link two events by cause
("because", "due to", "led to") unless a statement says so. Use "said", "alleged", "claimed", "denied"
only for the person or body a statement names in "said by"; never invent a speaker. When a statement
is itself reported speech ("A said that B claimed X"), keep it reported: never make A the author of X.
Every sentence must make sense on its own: never write "denied this" unless the sentence just before
says what was denied. Introduce every person and body at first mention with the fullest name and role
the statements give ("AAP Delhi chief Saurabh Bharadwaj", "Supreme Court judge Ujjal Bhuyan"); after
that, the surname ("Bharadwaj") or a short form. Never use a surname alone for someone not yet
introduced.
No headings, no bullet points.
Never name the same person, place or body twice in one sentence: the second time write "the river",
"he", "it" or the short name. Never use any of these words: {banned}
PARTS: when one sentence joins statements with DIFFERENT statuses (an ESTABLISHED fact and a detail
only ONE OUTLET reports, say), write it in two or three parts, the main fact first, each part with only
its own ids, split at a comma or "and": {{"parts": [{{"text": "Twelve crew members were injured in the
attack,", "ids": [4]}}, {{"text": "11 of them Indian nationals.", "ids": [9]}}]}}. Every number and name
in a part must come from that part's own statements. Otherwise write a sentence as one piece.
Every sentence lists in "ids" every statement it uses. Use EVERY statement at least once, including
those only one outlet reports: the reader gets everything known about the story, the past (CONTEXT
background), the present and what happens next.
