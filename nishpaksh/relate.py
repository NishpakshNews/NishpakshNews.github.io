"""Are two statements the same fact? One place decides it, for the whole pipeline (owner, Oct 7 2026).

It replaces a chain of judges that could each veto the others (Oct 5-7: real_difference,
typed_difference, frames, may_be_same, same_facts), where a weak model's labels outvoted the words:
"11 of the 12 injured crew members are Indian nationals", word for word from two outlets, stayed two
statements because the two readings labelled it "identify / nationality" and "be / Indian nationals".

The words outrank the labels. Judges, in this order:

  1. code, on the words themselves: the numbers (as numbers: "eleven" = 11, "1.2 lakh" = 120000),
     the names (capitalised words inside the sentence) and the root words (stemmed, small words out)
       same        identical wording; or the same numbers, the same names and almost the same words
       covers      one says everything the other says (every number, name and nearly every word) and more:
                   the detailed line takes in the short one ("12 crew members, including 11 Indians, were
                   injured" covers "12 crew members were injured")
       different   different numbers or names, one negated and the other not, or little in common
       ask         the same numbers and names, but worded differently enough that code cannot tell
  2. the model, only for "ask": one plain question (match.same_facts), asked twice with A and B swapped;
     only two "same" answers count
  3. labels (statement frames) only point to pairs worth looking at; they never block anything

A covered line is not merged into the detailed one (that would lend its outlets to details they never
reported, and could turn them green): it is kept, marked covered, and not written separately.
